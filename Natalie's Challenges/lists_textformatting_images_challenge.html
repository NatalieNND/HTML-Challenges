  <h2><em>Ingredients<strong></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>600-700 piece of fillet steak</li>
    <br>
    <li>heaped teaspoons French mustard</li>
    <br>
    <li>8-10 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce , plus extra for drizzling</li>
    <br>
    <li>a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil , plus extra to serve</li>
    <br>
    <li>2 sprigs of fresh rosemary</li>
    <br>

  <h2><em>Directions<strong></h2>
  <ul>
<li>The day before, or at least a few hours before cooking, put all the ingredients in a large sandwich bag (pick and finely chop the rosemary first).</li>
<br>
<li>Squeeze out the air then spend a few minutes massaging all the flavours into the meat. Put in the fridge for a few hours or overnight.
</li>
<br>
<li>About 1½ hours before you’re ready to cook, remove the beef from the fridge and place in a cool corner of the kitchen to come up slowly to room temperature.</li>
<br>
<li>Preheat your barbecue. Put a few knobs of chilled butter into a bowl of cold water and take those outside with you when you’re ready to cook.</li>
<br>
<li>This next bit is going to be down to you and your intuition. What works for me every time is taking the fillet out of the bag, quickly patting it with kitchen paper then rolling it in olive oil and putting it on the hottest part of the barbecue to give it colour. Rub it with a chilled knob of butter as you cook it for about 8 to 10 minutes, turning every minute.</li>
