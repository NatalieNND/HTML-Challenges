    <p>Puppies are one of my favourute animals in the world they always show kindness,happiness and are alsways playful.They make you happy when you feeling down and are always happy to see you walk in by the door.A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1-1.5 kg (1-3 lb), while larger ones can weigh up to 7-11 kg (15-23 lb). All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier.Never reach out and grab a puppy that doesn’t know you. Instead, talk gently to the puppy and offer him the back of your hand, with your fingers curled under, to sniff. Bring your hand slowly up to the puppy, and not down over his head. This lets him get used to your scent in a nonthreatening way and keeps your fingers out of his reach in case he decides to nip. Always keep your face back from the puppy, so that if he gets scared and tries to bite, he can’t reach your face.</p>
